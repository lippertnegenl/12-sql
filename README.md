Description:
For this assignment we were tasked to creating a database containing information about employees in a company.  I found this particularly helpful as I have worked in the manufacturing industry for about 6 years and this is a very practical program.  Almost every company has a database where it keeps information about its employees.  It is nice
to see that those categories are not set in stone and a company can contact the software company and have new categories added as needed and are not stuck with what they have.
